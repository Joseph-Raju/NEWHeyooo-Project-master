sorry for the mistakes and error made by during this presentation


I'd like to first mention that the biggest problems I encountered during this project were 

 simple things like accidentally putting a colon where a semicolon belong 

(for the last face  of  project it  Gave me weird errors like about 'product value been null')

 these errors  in the database took some time, which was c sorts of weird compiling issues.

so moving on , 

this project i done on,

Nodejs(expressjs)

Mongodb(Mongoose)

and ejs as template was used.

In this project,
Two models were created products and users.

User can add products  as many products and have to give title  image using url

and size of dress needed.Then  those products selected by them are 

showed as Wishlist products with there required size.

To run the program enter 

firstly install the dependencies by using,
npm install

npm start 

 add  a product by selecting  add-product tab on navigation bar

after adding required products

add need product to  wish list by clicking on the add to wishlist button.

By clicking on the wishlist it can displayed .
